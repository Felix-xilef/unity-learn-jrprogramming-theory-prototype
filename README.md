# Andorinha Faminta - Unity Programming Theory Prototype

![Game Banner](README%20Assets/banner.png)

Andorinha Faminta (Hungry Swallow) is the project I made during the last mission of **Unity Learn Junior Programming Pathway**.

Special thanks to ***BD Studios***, that provides the package [*Free Stylized Hand-Painted Skybox*](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/free-stylized-hand-painted-skybox-265475) for free in the assets store, which was used in this prototype.
